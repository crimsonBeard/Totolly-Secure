import repository_lib, repository_tool

# It starts here:
#       One file
#       Do not check on individual workflows... makes no sense
#       Checks to detect a behavior or pattern
#       Functions should include:
#           function to recurse to previous commit
#           using imported functions to grab metadata
#           function that has our algorithm to detect a pattern * the main one
#       The imported libraries have most or all of the TUF metadata grabbing stuff
